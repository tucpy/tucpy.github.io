### Short Bio

Hey, thank you for visiting my site! My name is Tu Le. I am a microbiologist trying to navigate my way through the invisible microbial universe.


### A brief summary about my life

Witness her grandmother died because of kidney cancer when she was 10, Tu (or Two) started her journey in biological research with the long-term goal to cure cancer. Eventually, through a few up and down events, life didn’t turn out as she expected. Joining the best NGO research institute in Vietnam [OUCRU](http://www.oucru.org/), she somehow finds herself around different kinds of microbes ranging from the deadly one causing meningitis to the one causing enteric diseases. Her curiosity in different domains of biology leads her to try a bit of everything including molecular biology, epidemiology and immunology. The explosion of genomic data available she will pursue bioinformatics with a goal to develop tools to automate gene searching. Her dream is to taming the microbes. She is currently trying to develop her coding skills by building small side projects. 

After all…
